Description: `tidymodlr` transforms long data into a matrix form to allow for ease of input into modelling packages for regression, pricipal components, imputation or machine learning. It does this by pivotting on user defined columns, generating a key-value table for variable names to ensure one-to-one mappings are preserved. It is particularly useful when the variablenames in the columns are long descriptive strings, for example "Energy imports, net (% of energy use)". High level analysis functions for correlation, imputation and principals components analysis are provided.
